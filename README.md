# ReadMe_Generator

## Descripton

This project uses Node.JS and the inquirer package to help users quickly create a README.md file for their projects. Using prompts in the terminal users can input answers to the questions which will then be displayed 
into the README.md under the corresponding headings. The user can also user the list prompt to select which license they are using within their project and a corresponding badge will be applied to the top of the README.md
